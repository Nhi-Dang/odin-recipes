    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>600ml milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan heat the caramel ingredients over
             medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the caramel has turned amber (roughly 3-5 
            minutes), take the saucepan off the heat. 
            Pour the caramel into the flan moulds.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a medium-sized bowl and set 
            aside.        </li>
        <li>Put the milk, sugar, vanilla and salt into a 
            medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Stir 
            until combined and all the sugar has dissolved,
             then keep heating until the mixture reaches 
             70 C / 158 F.</li>
        <li>Take the milk mixture off the heat and add the 
            eggs slowly through a strainer. Mix until 
            completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture again, then pour into the 
            moulds. Tap the moulds onto the towel a few
             times to remove any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>In a baking tray, lay down a tea towel. Put the
            moulds into the baking tray and fill the tray half 
            way up the moulds with medium-hot water from the
            tap. Do not use boiling water!</li>
        <li>Bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the moulds out of the tray. Let cool for 
            10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover the moulds and let it sit in the bridge for 
            at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Once ready to serve, run a knife around the edges to 
            unmould the flan, and turn it upside down on a plate. 
            The caramel will spill over the custard.</li>

    </ol>
